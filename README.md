# Interactive Computer Graphics - Marching Cubes Implementation

This repository contains the code implementation of Marching Cubes. 

### Libraries

In this repo, I've decided to use Numpy-STL to construct the mesh. Please install numpy-stl to run the code.
```
pip install numpy-stl
```

It is possible to render the mesh using Matplotlib, but I suggest rendering with Blender for larger meshed (larger than 64x64x64).


### About
The mesh will be saved as an 'STL' file. This file can be loaded in Blender for better visualization.
